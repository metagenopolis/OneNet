\title{Liver cirrhosis data set}
\format{
A list with the following components:
\itemize{
\item abundances: a 1990 x 216 matrix with (normalized) abundances of 1990 MSPs in the 216 samples of the Qin et al. dataset
\item metadata: a 216 x 27 data.frame with 27 descriptors for each sample in the dataset
\item infer_prev90: list of outputs reconstructed for different regularization parameter (lambda) values using 7 different methods (PLNnetwork, gCoda, SpiecEasi, SPRING, Magma, EMtree, ZiLN), using only MSPs with prevalence higher than 90\%
\item aggreg_data90: A 903 x 4 data.frame containing for each potential edge (row) between high prevalence (>90\%) species its summary statistics (mean, norm-2, IVW) and the number of methods for which
the edge has high inclusion frequency (> 0.9). Computed from \code{infer_prev90}.
\item aggreg_data50: A 12403 x 4 data.frame containing for each potential edge (row) between high prevalence (>50\%) species its summary statistics (mean, norm-2, IVW) and the number of methods for which
the edge has high inclusion frequency (> 0.9).Computed from \code{infer_prev50} (not provided).
\item taxonomy: a 1990 x 21 data.frame with descriptors of the MSPs
\item msp_set_50: character vector of the 158 MSPs with prevalence higher than 50\%
\item msp_set_90: character vector of the 43 MSPs with prevalence higher than 90\%

\description{
This data set contains abundance data, species taxonomy and sample metadata from \href{https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25079328/}{Qin et. al 2014}.
The liver data set also contains all results from 7 inference methods used on a filtered subset consisting of species with
prevalence higher than 90\% (\code{infer_prev90}). Those results have been processed with \code{adapt_mean_stability()} followed by
\code{compute_aggreg_measures()} to produce consensus networks (\code{aggreg_data90}). The same was done for taxa with prevalence higher
than 50\% (\code{aggreg_data50}).
}
\details{
The dataset has been cleaned to remove duplicates and contaminated samples.
