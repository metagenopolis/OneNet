OneNet is a stability based network inference aggregation method from whole metagenome sequencing data, which aims at fostering reproducibility and precision.

## Installation

You can install the latest version of OneNet from the with the following command :

```{r install, eval=FALSE}
remotes::install_github(repo = "metagenopolis/OneNet@*release"
```

## Liver data set

This package includes a data set "liver", which contains 

- Abundances (semi-discrete) and metadata for a trial on healthy and liver cirrhosis patients from  [Qin et. al 2014](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25079328/).
- A taxonomy table.
- Network inferences with 6 methods for a minimal species prevalence of 90% and 50%.
