## Installation

You can install OneNet from the [forgemia gitlab](metagenopolis/OneNet) with:

```{r install, eval=FALSE}
remotes::install_gitlab(repo = "metagenopolis/OneNet", 
                        host = "forgemia.inra.fr")
```

Or the development version with 

```{r install-dev, eval=FALSE}
remotes::install_gitlab(repo = "metagenopolis/OneNet@dev", 
                        host = "forgemia.inra.fr")
```

## Liver data set

This package includes a data set "liver", which contains 

- Abundances (semi-discrete) and metadata for a trial on healthy and liver cirrhosis patients from  [Qin et. al 2014](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25079328/).
- A taxonomy table.
- Network inferences with 6 methods for a minimal species prevalence of 90% and 50%.

```{r}
library(OneNet)
## basic example code
data("liver")
str(liver, max.level=1)
```
